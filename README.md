Allen Institute API Usage Examples
==================================

This github repostory hosts the code and documentation for examples of how to use the Allen Institute for Brain Science's [API](http://api.brain-map.org).  The examples range from simple python or shell scripts to full fledged visualization applications.  

Each example comes with a small descriptive web page, so it's easy to navigate the examples from your favorite web browser.  You'll need to start a web server in the api-examples root directory, which is simple enough if you have python 2.x:

    api-examples.git$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer

Then point your browser to [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).  Enjoy!
