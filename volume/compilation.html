	<h2> Pre-requisites </h2>
	
	<h3> 1. Qt </h3>
	
	<p> Qt is a cross-platform, open source application developing toolkit
	  that makes user interface development in C++ relatively simple.  Download
	  the latest <a href="http://qt.nokia.com/downloads">Qt libraries</a> for
	  your compiler of choice. You  may download the SDK if you wish, but note 
	  that the Windows SDK comes with MingW binaries only.</p> 

	<h3> 2. CMake </h3>

	<p> CMake is a build tool that makes cross-platform project organization
	  simpler.  You create a single project description (<tt>CMakeLists.txt</tt>)
	  and CMake will generate a compiler-specific project specification from 
	  there.  Download the <a href="http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html">latest version</a>.</p>

	<h3> 3. VTK </h3>

	<p> VTK is a C++ visualization library that has a large set of visualization
	  techniques available.  To compile VTK with Qt support, first download the VTK 
	  <a href="http://vtk.org/VTK/resources/software.html">source code</a> (not
	  the installer) and unzip to a directory of your choice.  Create a build
	  directory outside of the source code directory. You now have two directories,
	  for example:</p>
	
	<ul>
	  <li> <tt> C:\Code\VTK\VTK-5.8.0 </tt> </li>
	  <li> <tt> C:\Code\VTK\Build-5.8.0 </tt> </li>
	</ul>

	<p> Run the CMake GUI and give it the paths to your source and build 
	  directories. Click "configure".  In Windows, you will need to now 
	  indicate which compiler you will use.  When this is finished, ou 
	  will need to update two build options:  </p>

	<ul>
	  <li> <tt> BUILD_SHARED_LIBRARIES = On </tt> </li>
	  <li> <tt> VTK_USE_QT = On </tt> </li>
	</ul>

	<p> Click "configure".  CMake will run for awhile and then report that it
	  cannot locate the Qt libraries.  You will now need to update a third
	  build option to indicate the path of qmake, which comes with Qt.  
	  For example:</p>

	<ul>
	  <li> <tt> QT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE = C:\Qt\4.8.0\bin\qmake.exe </tt> </li>
	</ul>	

	<p> Click "configure" again.  When this is done, click "generate" to 
	  generate, for example, your Visual Studio solution file. Using the
	  example paths we used before, you will find that file here:</p>
	  
	<ul>
	  <li> <tt> C:\Code\VTK\Build-5.8.0\VTK.sln </tt> </li>
	</ul>

	<p> You can now build VTK as you would any other C++ project with your 
	  compiler. Where applicable, select the Release build configuration.</p>

	<h2> Compilation </h2>

	<p> The example code can be compiled with CMake.  Download the source archive
	  and unarchive it into a directory of your choice.  Create a build directory
	  somewhere outside of the build directory.  For example: </p>

	<ul>
	  <li> <tt> C:\Code\VolumeDemo\src </tt> </li>
	  <li> <tt> C:\Code\VolumeDemo\bin </tt> </li>
	</ul>

	<p> When running CMake, you will only need to update the <tt>VTK_DIR</tt> 
	  option to point to the <em>build</em> directory of VTK.  For 
	  example:</p>

	<ul>
	  <li> <tt> VTK_DIR = C:\Code\VTK\Build-5.8.0 </tt> </li>
	</ul>

	<p> After compiling the resulting project, you should have an executable
	  named <tt>VolumeDemoApp</tt>.  To run this application, all of the
	  related dynamic library files must be available in your environment
	  <tt>PATH</tt>. Specifically, this means that the Qt and VTK binary 
	  directories must be added to your <tt>PATH</tt>.  For example:</p>

	<ul>
	  <li> <tt> C:\Qt\4.8.0\bin </tt> </li>
	  <li> <tt> C:\Code\VTK\Build-5.8.0 </tt> </li>
	</ul>	

	<p> Alternatively, but less desirably, copy all of the dll/dylib/so 
	  files from the above directories into the directory containing the
	  VolumeDemoApp executable.</p>
